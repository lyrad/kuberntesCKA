Three APIs which can be applied to set who and what can be queried:
  - SelfSubjectAccessReview: Access review for any user, helpful for delegating to others.
  - LocalSubjectAccessReview: Review is restricted to a specific namespace.
  - SelfSubjectRulesReview: A review which shows allowed actions for a user within a particular namespace.

Command reconcile allows a check of authorization necessary to create an object from a file.
