### Cluster High Availability.
A cluster may join multiple CP nodes with collocated etcd databases (redundancy in case of CP down).
3 instances are required to be sure etcd database is not corrupt and elect a leader.

## Collocated Databases.
Use kubeadm command to join at least 2 more CP servers (same command than worker, with --control-plane flag and a certificate-key options).

## Non-Collocated Databases.
An external cluster can be used to store etcd database, resulting in less interruption when a node fail.

# Configuration.
The external etcd cluster needs to be configured first.
