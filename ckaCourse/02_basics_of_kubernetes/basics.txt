# Basics of Kubernetes

# What is it ?
Kubernetes: an open-source software for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
From google (borg).

# Components.
Micro-service architecture, deploying x small services rather than one monolithic (easier for scaling).
Transient nature also allows decoupling.

K8s is written in Go, JSON is the format for configuration, but in the fact written in YAML and converted before the
persistence in the database.
